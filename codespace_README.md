Here are things you should note while using the codespace:👇🏽

1. A codespace is an online coding environment. In other words, if you don't have visual studio on your local device, or if you don't know how to upload files from github website, you might want to upload them from the codespace.

2. We will soon implement a python script within the codespace that you can run to automatically upload your files and work to the repository (If for any of the reasons listed above, you prefer to upload them through the codespace)

3. Please bear in mind that the codespace has a limit of 120 hours per month. We are on free plan for now. So quit the codespace when it is not running, and make sure you have an understanding of what to do in it before your run it.

NB: If you're frontend, upload your files or work in "Frontend" folder. If you are "Backend", upload your files or work in Backend folder. If you are Smart contract, also upload your files or work in "Backend" folder. If you feel your work is general nature, upload it to "General" folder.

NB: If you have any urgent info or question, type it in questions.txt for anyone working here to check.

Thanks🙂
